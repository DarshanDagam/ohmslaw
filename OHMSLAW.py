        Ohm's Law states that the current flowing through a conductor between two points 
        is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional 
        to the resistance between them. The formula is:

        **I = V / R**

        Where:
        - I is the current in Amps (A)
        - V is the voltage in Volts (V)
        - R is the resistance in Ohms (Î©)
